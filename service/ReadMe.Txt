P2SET32 is a Windows program for setting up and tuning motors.  In
general it is not needed after initial commissioning. If a motor does
not run smooth anymore the fault is normally found in the mechanical
part of the axis. So do not play with it unless you fully understand all
motor related PMAC variables, and know how to change them in the Pmac
setup files.

The program included with this cd is organized into "Disks".  If you
need to install the program manually, go to Disk 1 of the program, and
double-click on the "Setup.exe" file; the program will install
automatically.
